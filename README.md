# RadialSymmetry (v1)
a Grasshopper plugin

![RadialSymmetry](/RS_visual.jpg)

Our process at [INFIMENSIONS](http://www.infimensions.com) cluster oftentimes involves designing based on *sacred geometry* and *mandala-style radial symmetry*. Instead of doing it manually in Rhino we were looking for **a quick and efficient way to instantly see how our design on one axis looks when rotated chosen number of times (axes) around a chosen point (origin).**

We couldn't find an existing solution, so we built one and decided to open source it for everyone to play with little to no previous experience.

* works with 2D objects, as well as 3D objects (but probably slower depending on your computer specs)
* quickly see design relations between axes
* copy the whole Grashopper patch if you need different plane, origin and/or number of axis for a different layer (as many as you need)
